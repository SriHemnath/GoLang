## Hackerearth Amazon question

Employees are tasked with generating valid discount coupons for customer.

The validity of a discount coupon is determined as follows:
1. An empty discount coupon is valid.
2. If a discount coupon A is valid, then a discount coupon C made by adding one character x
to both the beginning of A and the end of A is also valid (C=xAx is valid).
3. If two discount coupons A and B are valid, then the concatenation of B and A is also valid (AB and BA are both valid)
